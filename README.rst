DEPRECATED
==========

I have decided to deprecate this repository and the corresponding approach to photo management.
Instead, I have created a new knipse_ repository and CLI application that works as a complement to pix_ / gThumb_.
I am leaving the code available for public inspection hoping that someone might find it useful.

.. _knipse: https://github.com/luphord/knipse
.. _pix: https://github.com/linuxmint/pix
.. _gThumb: https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gthumb
